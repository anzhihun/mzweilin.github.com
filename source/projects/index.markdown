Here are a list of projects I have participated.

Artemis
--

Artemis is a distributed honeynet project undergoing at [NISL](http://netsec.ccert.edu.cn) of Tsinghua University.

6Guard
--
6Guard is an IPv6 attack detector aiming at link-local level security threats, including most attacks initiated by [the THC-IPv6 suit](http://thc.org/thc-ipv6/) and the advanced host discovery methods used by [Nmap](http://nmap.org). It can help the network administrators detect the link-local IPv6 attacks in the early stage.

The project is sponsered by Google Summer of Code 2012 and supported by The Honeynet Project organization. Thanks my mentor Ryan W Smith and the all in honeynet. The project page is at [Project 9 - IPv6 attack detector (Xu)](https://www.honeynet.org/gsoc/slots).

You can get the latest 6Guard from [https://github.com/mzweilin/ipv6-attack-detector](https://github.com/mzweilin/ipv6-attack-detector).

Nmap
--
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing.

Supported by Google Summer of Code 2011, I worked in the Nmap team as an IPv6 Expert (research oriented) during the 2011 summer, aiming at expanding and improving IPv6 support of Nmap, and developing new host discovery methods on IPv6 network. Thanks my mentor [David Fifield](http://bamsoftware.com) and the all in Nmap community.

Get the latest Nmap and you could experience the new features developed by us: [http://nmap.org](http://nmap.org).

NAPT66
-- 

IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Port Translation (NAPT66) is a stateful IPv6 NAT mechanism. Just like IPv4 NAT, NAPT66 technique makes several hosts share a public IPv6 address. As a result, NAPT66 helps to hide the private network topology and promote network security.

NAPT66 based on GNU/Linux is implemented in kernel space, which provides satisfied performance and portability. It has been ported to several open-source router firmware (e.g. OpenWrt) so that it can be run on low-end, commodity hardware (e.g. BCM63xx platform).

You can get the latest NAPT66 from [http://code.google.com/p/napt66/](http://code.google.com/p/napt66/).
